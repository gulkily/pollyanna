How I create a new install on a dreamhost shared hosting server.
================================================================

I added the domain and username. Let's say they are:

Domain: geekissues.net
Username: gidotnet
Password: hunter2

First of all, I made sure it was a shell user.
This is done in the Dreamhost control panel.

I logged in, and did the following

ssh gidotnet@geekissues.net
git clone ...
cd hike
./clean.sh ; ./build.pl

The build succeeded, so that's good.
Now on with the connecting it to the webserver.

cd ~
rm -rf ~/geekissues.net

This removes the existing directory for the website.
Going to geekissues.net now produces a 404 or placeholder page.

ln -s hike/html geekissues.net

This creates a soft-link to hike/html/ called geekissues.net, which is where
the webserver is looking for the webroot.
Loading geekissues.net now produces the home page.

We're not done yet, now to connect the access log.
I'll do this the other way: Instead of removing the original and creating a softlink,
I will remove hike/log/access.log and replace it with a softlink to
~/logs/geekissues.net/http/access.log

There are two settings I changed from their defaults:

config/admin/php/rewrite, from "query" to "all"
config/admin/php/update_on_post, from 0 to 1
