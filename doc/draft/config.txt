The configuration is designed to be self-explanatory
Under the config/ directory, there are sub-directories and files
One file is used per configuration setting
Most of the files have a 0 or 1 inside, sometimes a one-line string.
Each feature is in a sub-directory, for example, replying:

Examples:
config/reply/enable turns the reply feature on or off (1 or 0)

Commands to try:
cd ~/hike
ls config
find config | grep js
find config | grep php
find config | less

Information for Developer:

If a value is not found in config/, it is looked up in default/, and copied to config/

Commands to try:
cd ~/hike
ls default

If you're improving the software and you want to commit to repo,
 edit the files in default/ and let them propagate to config/

The _dev_clean_ALL script will remove most things under config/


SUMMARY
=======

config is stored in individual files per key

default/ directory has all the defaults

config/ directory overrides the defaults

===

most config is 0/1 or one-line string

config/admin/debug is a special one, file must be absent for debug to be off

===

example:

echo 1 > config/admin/js/enable
# enable javascript module

echo 0 > config/admin/php/enable
# disable php module
