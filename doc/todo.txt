what's left to do on modern theme
	alternating table row colors x
	table headers (don't appear at all)
		this is in GetDialogX2() in dialog_builder.pl
	finish template selection algorithm for perl files
		(currently dialog_builder.pl still needs to be copied manually to config/template/perl/
	timestamp widget colorization x
	notification/alert styling x
	beginner/advanced/admin layer colorization x
	table/dialog borders in dark mode
	what to do with <fieldset> tags?

===

Write link should pull a copy of the write page from local storage and replace local dom with it.

===

invite system for pre-vouching

===

ensure that cache and other files are cleaned up regularly
	write script to remove files more than 24 hours ago
		cache
		trim log file
		cache/b/response/*
		log/*.sqlerr

	call script regularly from ...?

===

write form should be updated when session status changes
	this happens, e.g., when auto_register is enabled

===

link items should be handled better
	link url should be accessible from item dialog displayed on any page
	should be a summary created by crawling the link, at least the title
	what else?

===

failure modes which need to be addressed
	too many processes lock up server
	too many files
	too much space used
	spam/crawler bots hitting the server too much (causing the above)

===

lowsrc thumbnails are too small, should be bigger
	test in netscape 3 and 4

===

make str_replace() and str_ireplace() consistent and the same implementation other than /i

===

person page should be updated when
	approve label is added
	new author is added

===

GetAvatar() should differentiate between approve and not approve
	it currently does, but once it's cached, it does not change

===

bug `hike refresh` fails if existing module has a syntax error
	even if new version in default/ has been fixed
	workaround: either remove the module in config/
		or hike clean, hike build

===

bug in profile_auto_register:
	public key is not shared until user clicks link on session page

===

jstest1 should not assume that document.frmTest exists
	some browsers do not yet support named forms
		e.g. Ladybird

===

to get a new cookie from a public key,
	the client should send a signed and timestamped request
		a) client signs the request with their private key
		b) server verifies the signature with the client's public key
		c) server sends a challenge to the client
			which the client must sign with their private key
			which the server must verify with the client's public key
		d) server sends a new cookie to the client

===

there should be a clear way to back up an entire server's data
	and there should be an easy way to validate/test that backup

===

changelog should appear immediately on New page after `hike refresh` is run
	changelog should be generated x
		this works ok
	changelog should be indexed
		for some reason this does not work until a reindex is done
		MakeIndex() does not work for some reason (fixed)
			this was because index.pl was not included x
		also, `hike index` does not add the changelog to the index for some reason
			cache/b/indexed/... is created, but the file does not exist in index
				i think it's created before the file is renamed, but then indexing fails because the file was renamed?
			removing this flag and running hike index fixes the issue
				part of the problem is that the cache/b/indexed/... cache contains the file path, but it is not checked whether it is the same
					confirmed this: indexed/... is generated, but the file does not appear in /new.html
						once i remove the indexed/... entry and reindex, it appears on new page
					added IsFileAlreadyIndexed() x
						is sometimes called without $file or $fileHash?
							still not clear what it returns, add debug output
		even though changelog text file is written, a full `hike rebuild` is required for the changelog to appear on new page
	new page should be updated
		MakePage('new') should be called after above works

===

fix duplicate pages being generated every time `page \#foo` is called
	example:
	1704657676.01219
    1704657676.42376 MakePage(tag, notext)
    1704657676.42376 =======================================================
    1704657676.42376
    1704657676.84397 MakePage(label, notext)
    1704657676.84397 =======================================================

===

rename labels_list to label_list ?
	or list_label?
	or list_labels?

===

i think the cause of netscape displaying very small thumbnails is lowsrc= being used
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-lowsrc
	we can probably just remove it

===

there should be a warning when 'hike refresh' would update some config items

===

fix 'hike pages' command
	currently prints 0 pages x
	it's using ./pages.pl --queue, and the queue is empty for some reason x
		select * from task; -- returns 0 rows x
	(this seems to happen on dreamhost servers, but not in dev environment) x
	this seems fixed

===

for write form, there should be a checkbox that tells the server not to add anything to the text file
            <br>
            <input type=checkbox>Do not stamp
            <br>
            <span id=spanWriteAdvanced class=advanced></span>

===

there should be a warning for the operator when using cookie-required features
	for example: require_cookie and force_profile (which should be called auto_session)
		these will block users who do not support cookies or have cookie issues

===

refactor all the mentions of opened_dialogs into ReopenDialogs()

===

backtick execute feature

===

refactor GetImageContainer() to use \%file instead of $fileHash as parameter
	allow for old style calls as well?
	currently GetImageContainer2()

===

how to rechain / multiple chain?
	a) get hash of current chain
	b) create new chain with announcement of previous chain's hash as the first item
	c) add all valid items in current chain to new chain
	d) replace current chain with new chain
	e) ???
	f) profit

===

why doesn't php InjectJs() use GetScriptTemplate() ? x
	it actually does!

===

<!--
    #todo redo this whole template
    the js should be added with AddAttributeToTag, not hard-coded into the template
        there can also be templates for each js, so that they can be reused elsewhere
            for example, there is also a standalone reset button

===

read-only mode for non-registered users
	this can be accomplished with require_cookie,
		but voting buttons and reply forms are still shown

===

add document.body.clientWidth and document.documentElement.clientWidth to jstest1.html

===

index.sqlite3 should not always be zipped
	when it is not zipped, demo is much smoother
	also, when zipped, there should not be subdirectories inside zip file
		the zip command flag is -j
	relevant lines:

		<a href="/index.sqlite3.zip">/index.sqlite3.zip</a> (<span id=sizeSqliteZip></span>) <br>
		{ #without zip

===

resultset dialogs should link to the full page and list total number of items

===

feature check for window.event (or whatever it is) before using "event."
	one browser where it causes problems: firefox 2.x (netscape 9)

===

Inbox dialog should have id=
	looks like there is also a bug with colspan= value missing in GetDialogX() in php version

===

`hike refresh` should look for new orphaned config/ files

how to import images
	background: text is pushed to the other server with a GET request
	this is not possible with most images
	easy alternative:
		request target server to pull it from source server
		concept: pull request
			if
				label = pull
				and there is a url in the item
			then
				pull the url
				and index it
		implementation:
			token_defs.pl:
				add pull token

===

allowed and supported image file types
	should have a central config

Traditionally, a FILE_ID.DIZ should be "up to 10 lines of text, each line being no more than 45 characters long",
according to v.1.9 of the specification.[3] The concept of .DIZ files was to allow for a concise description of
uploaded files to be automatically applied.
FILE_ID stands for "file identification". DIZ stands for "description in zipfile".[2]

todo: add traps for this error message
workaround:
	continue using site without javascript features

		hike set js/enable 0 # this will turn off javascript rendering on the entire site, for all users
		turn off javascript support in browser
			about:config, javascript.enabled

===

it is a general problem that js errors are not trapped and communicated to user
	example: when the meditate message appears on the screen and does not go away

demo transition from localhost:8000 to hypercode.com
	0) localhost theme differs from hypercode.com theme
		on local server: echo "hypercode chicago" > config/theme
		on remote server: should already be set to this theme

	a) user becomes immersed in the demo experience
		page through all the menu items
		begin smoke testing with different browsers
		begin a roll call thread
		click a few things
		return to the write page
	b) with user's explicit opt-in consent,
		except when the demo smoothness and magic trick requires it not to be?
		when the write form submits a new item, the form targets hypercode.com
	b1) this is done with a selector checkbox
		to be implemented
	c) the lie is that localhost:8000 is entirely static, which may seem like magic because we ran python -m http.server ;)
		the other lie is that we redirected the user to a new server which looks like the old server and without their consent
			make the write page say "you have set your publish node to hypercode.com"
		the alternative is that the localhost theme does not match the hypercode.com theme,
			and the viewer becomes aware of the change,
			although they do not immediately know what it is
	d) the truth is that localhost:8000 is a proxy to hypercode.com
	e) the user is given a link to hypercode.com
	f) the user is given a link to the source code
	g) the user is given a link to the documentation
	h) the user is given a link to the demo
	i) the user is given a link to the demo source code

	d) if it is an item page, look for these (for each tag):
		template/css/page/item/tagname.css
		template/css/page/item/tagname.js
		* this is complicated by getpageheader/footer not getting the item it for current page?
	e) implement saving of template contents

CACHING CACHING CACHING CACHING CACHING CACHING
	main pages which rarely update should have different timeouts

===

should be able to go straight to editing a query on any view page
	one way to do this is to just put the query into a textarea
		more compatible
	another way to do this is to createElement('textarea')
		makes page look nicer

===

#bug PubKeyPing() is not compatible with relativized urls at the moment

===

fresh.js should be more persistent
	when a page goes 404, check less frequently, but still check now and then
	gradually reduce frequency of checks after a while
		(see metafilter article)

===

how to thorough cache invalidation basic
	item's page
	item's author's page
	item has parents?
		recurse through each one (only up)
	item's tag's pages
	item has children?
		recurse downwards (only down)
	chain, new, etc.
	grep for other pages and issue warning so that they can be added

===

notify user of anything they may want to see
	highest priority:
		replies to anything they've posted
		mentions
	lower priority:
		anything containing text on the server
	more?
	1) design query author_repliesx
	2) make GetAuthorRepliesDialog()x
	3) make trigger in pages.pl
		basic version: auto generate the dialog when generating author's pagex
	4) in route.php,
		if there's a current author (cookie)x
			check for dialog existencex
				if dialog exists, inject it into pagex
	it would be nice if author had some context what the replies are to
		but this basic version is a good start
	dialog should be re-generated whenever a reply is made where there's an author
	* query should exclude items author has already replied to or voted on
	* add author_key field to query once that's more efficient

===

add recovery from this warning:
	GetItemDetokenedMessage: warning: NO FILE: $messageCacheName =
		a) search for matching file in htmlt/xt
		b) reindex file
		c) look for message again

===

problems found during some testing

a) on mac, setup is a bit broken
	a1) needs a command which does these: hike alog; hike index; ./pages.pl --all
		a1a) hike needs more options to call pages.pl, so that pages.pl doesn't need to be called anymore
	b) item received page needs more instructions on how to refresh the site
	c) hike should offer to run enable_features.sh, or prompt the user to do so
	d) mac-- php is still broken, and ssi is not enabled by default

===

add perl-unicode-string to requirements x

===

===

there's a serious bug with data sanitizing
	reproducing: download all text files from 26-110.com
		some text files are actually image files

				#ouch
	i think this may have something to do with tcsh

===

	add default/theme/thankyou/template/html/page/thanks.template
	add to $validMakePageNames in HandleNotFound() handle_not_found.php
	add to @simplePages in MakePage() makepage.pl
	the good news is that it is already automatically generated when ./pages.pl --all is called
		probably from the menu list though?
			#todo it should probably have a list of all available pages somehow
	#todo something like perl/page/simple.pl that is also checked for when a simple pages is generated?

===

how to jump up and down the outline to change reply-to item?

===

fresh.js
	needs to recover when page goes away (404) and subsequently recovers

===

reset button setting should be under php because it depends on it?

===

what needs to be uncached when a new item is indexed?
	new
	chain
	authors
	tags
	entire parent tree
	author of item
	affected authors if in parent tree
	top/ pages for all affected hash tags
	all dialog versions of above
	previous item in chain
	lower priority
		compost
		threads

===

if chain is in use, during rebuild items should be indexed in chain order
	how?
		either defer indexing if previous items are not done yet
			index_queue
			add to queue if parent item is missing, then rerun queue once first pass of indexing is done?
				recursively
		or build list of files based on chain?
			would require organize_files to be on

===

should all-lowercase and/or lowercase hashtags be in the advanced layer?

===

problems with hashtag links
	#duplicatedialogs
	a) dialogs have a hash-based id rather than exact id
		#todo give unique prefix to hashtag-matching items listing dialogs
			it is top_
	b) FetchDialogFromUrl() doesn't know how to check for existing dialog
		should not be called directly, only by FetchDialog()

column headers should feedback sort order and click

===

#bug access_log_read.pl does not pick up boxes: parameter

===

#bug rss feed is not generated by default

===

#bug GetFileMessage() relies on organize_files being on

===

reply(#) link should not appear if reply/enable is false

===

upload dialog should be separated from paste dialog?

===

handle ^M line breaks as early as possible

===

when a pubkey fails a sanity check, the item template is just blank
	there is also no parse log
		may be nice to give some kind of feedback

===

dialog palette
	pre-populate with dialogs on pagex
	in the event loop, check for new ones just in casex
	put new dialogs into palette when they are injected into pagex
	checkboxes in palette should hide/show dialogs
	palette should also contain advanced/beginner toggle button
	palette should not be affected by advanced/beginner

===

before cleaning db, dump the file to hash mapping in item table
	restore it when rebuilding
		but do not set cache/b/indexed, so that file gets indexed again
			this will allow OrganizeFile() to work properly with RenameFile()

===

organizing files and indexing files should be separate processes

===

loading indicator can be implemented without js #idea
	float it at the top of the page with css
	at the bottom of the page, hide it with !important

===

IndexImageFile() should also use cache/indexed/... to keep track of what's already been indexed
	the same way as IndexTextFile()

===

there should be a command which checks all references to a hash
	paths in html/txt
	any items in database
	fingerprints of users
	fulltext search

===

make it so multiple dialogs can be requested at once!

rss feed link should be at the bottom of the markup
	lynx displays it at the top of the page, which is sub-optimal

===

admin tag should only be applied to pubkey items?

===

#todo
	store preferred dialogs and open them on page load
	store the dialog html in localstorage

===

allow for baking in GetConfig() values at the templating level
	this will save many GetConfig() calls

===

mechanics of overthrow (like remove ops on irc)

	if config/template has changed
	if perl build.sh
	if php or html just rm config/template/html then clean html

do not exclude hashtags from titles?
	it creates meaning loss when the hashtag is part of the message

===

put top parent id into thread dialog
	generate a template for that thread
		replace the thread in templates when served with php

===

put writing settings on write page
	it's missing <form> tag in all instances
		make a GetFormTemplate extension for GetDialogX which wraps form tag around it

===

notifications of new mentions
	mentions should be indexed
		(currently just replaced when html rendered)
	append to author/hash/mentions.txt

===

new/injected dialogs should appear centered in the viewport
	and possibly animate out?

===

mentions
========
pick up author references by fingerprint during indexing
	add to token_defs
		add to mentions.txt under profile/ABCDEF0123456789/mentions.txt
			read mentions.txt with js

===

client-side frontend config
===========================
2 methods
	1) cookie-based
	2) localstorage-based

===

cascade should be ordered by window size
	larger windows up front because it's easier to focus them from bottom up that way
		width + height = size?

===

#lilatom
	color scheme
	collecting recordings

===

MakePage() output
	should be able to output file name determined by feature flags
	parameters can be set in pages.pl call

===

#hotloading
	find config/setting -type f | sort | xargs md5sum | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1 > config/hash_setting
	#diff against stored_config_checksum
		#if different, run appropriate processes

	deleted
	some item pages (from chain verification table)

===

dragging: Zorder on page load
	determine dialog importance by counting clickable objects inside

===

build/start.sh should create an alias in the shell
	so that you can type $ hike whatever at the cli
		without having to permanently change config

===

there is a bug:
	when php is off
		and access log is parsed
			it doesn't make it onto the chain until rebuild
				until double-rebuild, actually
		also, the post page doesn't have anything on it
	update: something is going wrong to call to IndexFile() from access_log_read.pl
		#IndexFile($addedFilename);
		disabling this call makes it so that rebuild is no longer required
			however, there is a delay in flow, because index.pl and pages.pl must be called after access.pl

===

===

#bug why isn't it displaying server messages when redirected with php??
	#lighttpd

===

add automatic de-caching of affected pages
	verify that item_page table is updated correctly
	run through item_page table and delete affected pages

===

add a default text and non-text colors for each theme to reduce the appearance of green for missing colors

===

Sources of developer confusion
==============================
symlinked .pl files in root dir should not be edited

===

	it does now

===

What's Keeping Website From Being Used?
=======================================
Much confusion
Where to find newest posts??
Search
	xSearch form
	xGet search query
	Fetch results
	Display results
		via access.log (delayed)
		via php
	Search results template page
xRebuild times are long due to generating a page for each item
	Good: Site is fast to come back up
	xNeed: lazy-generate pages with PHP is enabled
		xItem
		xTag
		xAuthor
		xOther
	Need: Avoid generating pages for items with a parent
		Perhaps: Remove permalinks from reply items
	Need: "Site is rebuilding right now" message?
User can't create account from Write or Reply page
	Need: Checkbox to create account in the process of posting
Data export is currently only possible individually (zip files are not generated)
	Need: Generate zip files for each thread, probably on the fly with PHP, if possible
	Need: Generate zip files of forum data:
		By thread (with all dependencies like authors, votes, etc.)
		By date (with all deps)
		By author (with all deps)

===

Basic calendar view
	templatify it all
	fuzzy date match when creating

		changes /index.html to status message
		performs upgrade
		build.sh

===

admin imprint key
	email version
		user enters email which hashes
		server sends one-time auth token to email

===

#burnit token
	note: you can't burn electrons

===

.js files can fall behind in version
	self-check against etag somehow

===

more testing with failed db connection
	fallback solutions

===

cron.lock : change from timestamp-based to timestamp + pid based
	if timestamp is too old, change the pid
	if pid doesn't match self, quit
		check on every loop

===

aliases based on item attributes
	/123 == could be anything
		chain order
		partial title

===

de-couple
	indexing of file into intial hash-filename pair

===

useful structural tags
	>>item #addparent <hash>
		add parent to item
	>>item #reparent <hash>
		remove all other parents and attach to <hash>
	>>item #adopt
		sets posting as belonging to author
	>>item #replace [hash]
		if no hash, replace with self
		otherwise replace with item with that hash
			this would mean content is replaced on the page
				with a notice
	>>item #deparent
		make it a top-level thread (no parents)

===

any account tagging v2
	1) create profile
	2) post "verify <profile>" on reddit userpage
	3) >>profile verify https://... (index.pl)
	4) curl reddit profile url, look for confirmation
		use ./once for caching (task?)
	5) add reddit_username attribute to profile

===

reddit account tagging
	(this is already implemented as proof of concept)
	1) "i claim this reddit account http://
	2) >>1 #redditclaim

			server-signed "#approve"
		else
			message that it failed, and don't try again until this message is removed
			still save it in ./once/
			#denied
	if you want a do-over, you have to remove the once somehow

If you are looking for the $_FILES['error'] code explanations, be sure to read:

===

Handling File Uploads - Error Messages Explained
http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.errors.php

===

25 sparticvs at popebp dot com ¶7 years ago
	A note of security: Don't ever trust $_FILES["image"]["type"].
	It takes whatever is sent from the browser, so don't trust this for the image type.
	I recommend using finfo_open (http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.finfo-open.php) to verify the MIME type of a file.
	It will parse the MAGIC in the file and return it's type...this can be trusted
	(you can also use the "file" program on Unix, but I would refrain from ever making a System call with your PHP code...that's just asking for problems).

===

#bug loading indicator doesn't go away on pages without openpgp.js

===

For an item page with a reply box
	Move the voting/response hash tag buttons to the reply form
		Or to a separate page/dialog
			Should be a "dialogs" dialog
				This feature already exists for open dialogs, but not for common ones (for the item)
					Currently this is accomplished only with beginner/advanced layers
===

During overthrow, automatically re-vouch previous admin
	I think continuity is expected by most

===

Make it so that all 500 bajillion index pages aren't rewritten at once

place to enter private key into textbox
	just like show private key link
	but also with a button
	it used to be that way, so id_create or id_current may have the code

===

deleted items page
	add explanation:
	X items are deleted. Here are their IDs and comments on them

===

some html templates
	like controls
		onclick, onchange, etc. events should be separated out
			so that they are not printed when config/admin/js/enable is 0

===

assigning someone a tagset should allow them to assign all the tags in the tagset

===

local save
	autosave to localstorage
	autosave to cookie

	how to insert picture into post?
		perhaps >>
size stuff may not be as important if
	on pages, display standardized image (standard dimensions)
	link to original image (not necessary)
images should be rotated properly
	when exif tags specify rotation, it should be saved properly in thumbnails

===

#bug relative redirects don't work on some browsers
	like mosaic, see above

===

research .user.ini (php settings for apache)

===

===

When returning to a form with a button which turns to "please wait" when clicked
	xThe button's caption should already be reset, ideally (via document/body.onunload?)
		Or should be reset as soon as possible
		{ // add this to top of page
			<script>
				<!--
				if (document.createElement && document.innerHTML) {
					var styleHideDialogs = document.createElement('style');
					styleHideDialogs.setAttribute('type', 'text/css');

	event.html handlers are broken

===

HASHTAG VOTES SHOULD APPLY TO PARENT ITEMS
If item is a reply
	If contains hashtag
		Hashtag vote applies to parent
Implementation:
	Stupid way
		1. Index and store all hash tags for given file_hash
		2. Integrate into item_view page if it's top-level
	Smarter way
		1. Create a view which does it automatically for parent-level items
	3.

===

Views
	Outputs: html listing, rss, zip, pdf, epub, docx, rtf, txt

===

	the actual solution is
		with javascript, the urls can be fixed post-loading
		without javascript, they can be fixed with ssi or php
		with full static only mode, ????

Bug: There's a duplicate <a name=maincontent> on home page

===

Problem
=======
Whole install can be clobbered by setting a value on a directory
#dupe

===

Safe mode:
	If any kind of error occurs
		Rename txt dir
			Create new blank txt dir
				Avoid adding anything to it, but maybe one small message on what just happened?
				Provide zip file of previous directory?
					Maybe just on the first try, as this can cause an error as well

===

Side-quest
==========
Report bug to lighttpd team
	Bug is that directory listings cause JS error in NN3 and other pre-=== browsers
		There's probably no huge need to use that operator there
			Maybe investigate if anything else would cause error?
				Submit patch?
	Update: reported, and they said wontfix. maybe try again?

	Typically sent with static html files
	How to disable it?

FEEDBACK FROM L.F.
==================
it might be helpful to have the tags right on the home page, so that it's not landing on a jumble of messages.
Other things can be used to categorize these textboxes and give them more meaning to the user, such as titles, dates, etc.
It might be somewhat counter-intuitive to have the pages going from 14-0 on the top, maybe consider adding a "go back" alongside/instead of these.
xUnderlining 'publicly and right now' may be confused as a hyperlink, maybe can be left un-underlined. but if you want to emphasize this consider bold or italics
xAlso, as a personal preference I think the ellipse around the numbers can be removed or made into a rectangle
And consider adding a title/informative header to the page in general, to give more context to what this page is.
	It could be something like "hike.qdb.us" on the very top, a very short description underneath it, and then tabs (home, write, tags, manual) go underneath that

Version: OpenPGP.js v3.0.13
Comment: https://openpgpjs.org

message is included when signing proof of work puzzle from welcome page

===

#bug when access log and received: header is turned on, many duplicate items appear because the hash is no longer not applied to the footer

===

#bug author's page does not seem to display all items

===

#todo needs to be more indication of how the score is composed

===

#todo
	/image.html should be reprinted after new image is uploaded
		location: IndexImageFile()

===

profile.html should redirect to referring page logging in
	url retains original parameters like btnBegin=...
		this doesn't always happen

===

Welcome page should look different for a logged in user?
	Logged in user should know they are logged in on any page

===

#todo date page should display date used
	workaround: look at url

===

===

Message Hash should be consistent across messages with the same text.

===

route.php should be able to individually generate pages like browser test and manual should be
	currently it's all done with one call to GetSystemPages(), which is kind of slow

===

	this is already done with client: header and client_id attribute

===

#todo page titles have issues
	some page titles are lowercase
	item pages are titled with the item's hash instead of item's title
	non-ascii titles are mistranslated

===

when user logs in, their welcome page changes, and this triggers a "page updated" notification
	probably should not happen on the welcome page,
		as it is confusing and doesn't help the user,
		who is waiting for their proof-of-work puzzle to complete
